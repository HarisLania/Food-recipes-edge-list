# Network-of-food-recipes
. The objective of our graph is to observe the use of various ingredients in different recipes. We obtained two different graphs after converting the initially obtained bipartite graph into unipartite.
The first graph has ingredients as vertices and the edge between two ingredients shows that they were used in the same recipe.
The second graph has recipes as vertices and the edge between two recipes shows that they have some ingredients in common.
